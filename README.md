## About
Create and Manipulate Pandas DataFrames and charts with Matplotlib to analyze cancer drug regimens for Pymaceuticals, Inc. for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) given the results of a recent animal study.

## Getting Started
All necessary files are located in this matplotlib-challenge repository. 

The matplotlib-challenge folder contains the files pymaceuticals.ipynb and pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb. pymaceuticals.ipynb is the file that you will want to run! The other is for reference as to what we were given to start with and samples of the expected outputs.

The pymaceuticals folder also contains a data folder which contains the files Mouse_metadata.csv and Study_results.csv which are used for input data for pymaceuticals.ipynb.


## Installing
This was run using gitbash on a Windows 10 Pro system.
Jupyter Lab and Pandas
Python 3.10.11
conda 23.5.0


## Usage
Initiate gitbash on the matplotlib-challenge folder.  
Enter "conda activate dev" into gitbash to initiate a dev environment.
Enter "jupyter lab" to open Jupyter Lab at the matplotlib-challenge folder.
You should see the pymaceuticals.ipynb file.

Open and run pymaceuticals.ipynb.

The outputs should be similar to the outputs provided in the pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb file.

Make sure you are not using pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb which is only included for comparison purposes!!!!!
